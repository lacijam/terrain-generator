# Terrain Generator

This tool lets you create and modify procedural terrains using Perlin noise.

This tool was build with C++, OpenGL and ImGUI for the UI. The project is part of a final year project for my undergraduate degree.

## Building

To build this project you can use the provided Visual Studio 2019 solution, a copy of ImGUI is present in the `code` folder and there are no other 3rd party dependancies. This project only runs on a Windows operating system and I have only tested it on two windows 10 machines both running intel processors, one with a dedicated Nvidia GPU and the other using the integrated intel graphics processor.
